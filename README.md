# Cat Crew: Energy Clicker

A lightweight incremental clicker where a team of helpful cats generates **energy** over time. Click to gather, hire cats to automate, and upgrade your click power.

## Process (super short)

Started from a barebones click-to-earn loop, then layered producers (EPS), upgrades, save/load.

Kept strict TypeScript checks, keyboard access (Space/1–5/U), and hover tooltips for clarity.

Re-skinned late to the “cat crew” theme without changing core structure, so iterations stayed small and safe.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
## Inspiration for second iteration D1.d
1. Carrot Coins (KupoDupo) I loved how their central “carrot” hero image sat on top of a playful clover background, giving instant theme clarity and charm.

2. Cat Clicker UI (Selcomd) I liked how their UI felt responsive thanks to subtle button depth/press states and helpful inline explanations; it made actions feel more confident and guided.
